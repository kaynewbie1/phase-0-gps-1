#Kalier Howard's GPS 1.1 Reflection Notes
* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
  - Understanding where to create new branches and merge conflict resolution.
* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
   - Git Pull versus Git fetch and Git Merge was the main clarification I remember the most. Very helpful. Thanks Ryan.
* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
 - I had not used Git in a few days and had forgotten some key commands, so my pair assisted me in remembering a few key commands. Our Guide explained that practice will help to make the commands really commit to memory. We did ask our guide about Git Pull and when to use it and what was the difference between pull versus fetch and merge. Ryan was great.
* **What still confuses you about Git?**
 - I am still not 100% sure about resolving merge conflicts because we were not sure if we were supposed to remove the special characters ( ====, <<< and >>> ) and were not sure if the conflict fixes itself automatically.  We also were not sure if we were to push it to GitHub so it is still local on Jerome's computer.
* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
 - It was a great experience. I was nervous at first but it went well.
